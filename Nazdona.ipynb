Kabateraine\\nCountry: China\\nRPD Number: TB9-12791\\nAssociated RPD Number(s):\\nATIP Number: A-2021-01106\\nATIP Pages: 000110-000117\\nREASONS FOR DECISION\\n[1] [XXX] (the claimant) claims to be a citizen of China and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\\u201cthe Act\\u201d)[1].\\nALLEGATIONS\\n[2] The claimant\\u2019s allegations are fully set out in the Basis of Claim form (BOC). In summary, the claimant alleges a fear of persecution in China at the hands of the government due to his membership in the particular social group of Falun Gong practitioners.\\nDETERMINATION\\n[3] I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Act.\\nANALYSIS\\nIdentity\\n[4] The claimant\\u2019s personal and national identity as a citizen of China has been established on a balance of probabilities by his resident identity card[2], hukou and oral testimony[3].\\nCredibility\\n[5] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption of truth unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\\nThe claimant practiced Falun Gong in China\\n[6] I find that the claimant was introduced to Falun Gong in [XXX] 2018. He testified that he went to a park near his family home on weekends when he visited and observed people doing exercises. He testified that after speaking with one of the practitioners he confided in him that he was diagnosed with Hepatitis B which was not responding well to treatment. During his testimony, the claimant testified that he spoke with the group leader in [XXX] 2018. When confronted with the discrepancy between his narrative where he states he was introduced to the group leader on [XXX] 2018 and not [XXX] 2018, the claimant said that he was not formally introduced in [XXX] but merely chatted informally with the group leader. I reject the claimant\\u2019s explanation. The claimant is well educated. He has a [XXX] in [XXX] and worked as an [XXX] and [XXX] in China. He is [XXX] years old. His narrative specifically states that he was approached by the leader on or about [XXX] 2018. There is no mention about any prior communication only that the claimant was watching people doing exercises. Taking into account, the claimant\\u2019s education and work history, his explanation for an omission about a central event in his claim is not credible. I draw a negative inference.\\n[7] The claimant testified that he joined the group practice in a corner of a park in his neighbourhood. When asked if he had any concerns about practicing in a public space considering that Falun Gong was banned in China, he testified that the group was surrounded by trees and it would be difficult to see what the group was doing and the group kept the size to six people. The claimant said he practiced with the group for about a month on Saturdays.\\n[8] I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was introduced to Falun Gong in China and joined the group practice. Although there are a couple of credibility concerns, the claimant described how he was taught exercise one in a very detailed and spontaneous manner which is consistent with the Falun Gong text[4] and his testimony was generally consistent with his narrative. He submitted a medical record which indicates his diagnosis date and repeated treatments for persistent Hepatitis B which are consistent with his narrative[5]. Therefore, the credibility concerns are insufficient to undermine his overall testimony about his introduction to and practice of Falun Gong in China.\\nThe claimant feared arrest by the PSB in China\\n[9] The claimant testified that there was an incident on [XXX] 2018 which caused him to stop group practice. He testified that he was at a convenience store near the park where he practiced and saw PSB officers and vehicles outside. He said the store staff told him that some people involved in an evil cult were arrested at the park plaza and some escaped but the PSB said they would be caught and arrested. The claimant testified that he had no way to contact the group leader and since he had provided the leader with his name and address, he decided to stop group practice and instead practiced alone at home.\\nThe claimant omitted his resignation from his job after [XXX] 2018\\n[10] The claimant testified that he resigned from his job but continued to live at his rented apartment which was close to his place of work. The claimant did not mention that he stopped working in his narrative. When confronted with this omission, he testified that he did not think this was an important detail. The claimant also failed to indicate that he stopped working in [XXX] 2018 in his immigration forms but instead indicated that he continued to work until [XXX] 2018 at which time he left China. When confronted with this discrepancy, the claimant testified that he made a mistake. I reject the claimant\\u2019s explanation. Deciding to resign from one\\u2019s workplace because of fear is a detail which is directly connected to the core of this claim. The claimant was very precise in completion of his immigration forms and he is well educated and worked as an accountant, a profession that is focused on details. I draw a negative inference from this omission and discrepancy.\\nThe claimant travelled circuitously on route to Canada\\n[11] The claimant testified that an agent arranged for his departure from China. He said he left China on [XXX] 2018 and travelled through a number of Caribbean countries staying from a month to several months in each country before arriving in Canada on [XXX] 2019. When asked about this lengthy and circuitous journey, the claimant testified that he did not know the reason but was following the directions of the agent. The claimant was asked if he questioned the agent about this lengthy route and he said he did and was told not to ask too many questions.\\n[12] Since the claimant was reliant on the agent to secure his arrival in Canada, the nine-month delay is reasonable under these circumstances.\\nThe claimant is also a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada\\n[13] I find that the claimant continues his Falun Gong practice in Canada. He testified that he continued to practice Falun Gong in Canada. He said he attends group practice at Milliken Park, distributes pamphlets and attends group study. The claimant provided detailed testimony about his first practice at Milliken Park and described taking the bus there and hearing the Falun Gong music as he walked through the park. He said he purchased Zhuan Falun and the Great Consummation Way of Falun Dafa at Pacific Mall. The claimant testified that he attends group practice weekly except on rainy days and he said he stopped attending once the COVID-19 lockdowns occurred. Overall his testimony was spontaneous, detailed and he elaborated with additional details when they were requested. He also submitted photos and a letter from a fellow practitioner to support his testimony[6].\\nClaimant demonstrated knowledge of Falun Gong consistent with his profile\\n[14] I find that the claimant demonstrated Falun Gong knowledge commensurate with his profile. The claimant testified about jealousy being the most harmful attachment and explained in great detail how this attachment impedes cultivation and why it is prevalent in Chinese culture. He described the three principles and how they affect mind nature, explained the origins of karma and the purpose of the exercises. He provided an example of how he incorporates the principle of truth in his life and correctly explained that the exercises are not for the purpose of healing rather to purify the body. The claimant also explained the purpose of sending righteous thoughts and described activities such as attendance at a rally on World Falun Dafa Day and distribution of pamphlets to clarify the truth. The claimant\\u2019s testimony was very detailed, spontaneous and demonstrated in-depth knowledge about Falun Dafa.\\n[15] When asked if he would continue to practice Falun Gong if he returned to China, the claimant responded in the affirmative and explained that his energy level is low and must be increased and also if he stopped practice, his karma would return and create adverse affects on his health.\\nObjective Basis\\n[16] The objective evidence is consistent with the claimant\\u2019s account of fearing persecution as a Falun Gong practitioner in China[7].\\n[17] At item 2.1 of the NDP, the US Department of State confirms that the People\\u2019s Republic of China, is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, is the paramount authority. Repression and coercion persist, including against members of banned religions and/or spiritual practices such as Falun Gong.\\n[18] An IRB Response to Information Request or RIR[8] on the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners contains information that further confirms there is a serious possibility that the practice of Falun Gong will be met with persecution.\\n[19] Chinese authorities continue to label Falun Gong an \\u2018evil cult\\u2019 in China. In particular, items 2.1 and 12.23 of the NDP reference the State\\u2019s use of harassment, intimidation, imprisonment and torture against Falun Gong practitioners. The 2019 Commission on International Religious Freedom, item 12.2, indicates that as of February 1, 2018 new regulations on religious affairs came into effect detailing strict registration criteria for religious organizations. The regulations ban unauthorized religious teaching and expands the role of local authorities in controlling religious activities. Further as of March 2018, jurisdiction over religious affairs was transferred from the State Administration of Religious Affairs (SARA) to the United Front Work Department (UFWD), an organ of the CCP. International criticism of China increased during the latter half of 2018 as the scale of government crackdown on religious freedom became widely publicized.\\n[20] I find that the claimant\\u2019s fear of persecution because of his Falun Gong practice has an objective basis and is well-founded, especially since he has credibly established that he was a Falun Gong practitioner in China and continues to practice in Canada.\\nState Protection\\n[21] A state, unless in a condition of complete breakdown, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing confirmation of the state\\u2019s inability to protect its citizens.\\n[22] Given that the state is the agent of persecution, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek the protection of the state in his circumstances, and that adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\\n[23] Given that the state is the agent of persecution with control over the entire country, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout China and therefore a viable IFA does not exist.\\nCONCLUSION\\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution in China. I find that the claimant is a Convention refugee and I accept his claim.\\n[1] Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\\n[2] Exhibit 1\\n[3] Exhibit 4\\n[4] Exhibit 3, Item 12.7\\n[5] Exhibit 4\\n[6] Exhibit 4\\n[7] Exhibit 3\\n[8] Exhibit 3, Item 12.9\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 91,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Barbados\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"case_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PSG: SOGIE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"member\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 360,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Heidi Worsfold\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And you will also receive a written version of this decision in the mail, okay? So I will begin by telling you that my decision is a positive one (1), and I have accepted each of your claims, so congratulations.\\n\\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\\n\\n[3] ASSOCIATE CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\\n\\n[4] MEMBER: You\\u2019re very welcome. I\\u2019m now going to read you the reasons for my decision, and they\\u2019re a bit lengthy, so just bear with me while I read those, okay?\\n\\n[5] Okay, this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of XXXX XXXX, and his spouse, XXXX XXXX, and their daughter, XXXX XXXX of Ukraine, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA.\\n\\n[6] At the hearing, the associate claimant, who is the mother of the minor claimant, acted as the designated representative for her daughter pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act, and Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\\n\\n[7] I have considered and applied the Chairperson\\u2019s Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, which offers guidance with respect to any gender-specific issues present in this claim.\\n\\n[8] I\\u2019ve also applied and considered the Chairperson\\u2019s Guidelines on child refugee claimants, procedural and evidentiary issues as it relates to the claim of the minor claimant.\\n\\n[9] The claimants were self-represented for their hearing.\\n\\nDETERMINATION\\n\\n[10] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine. I also find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on his well-founded fear of persecution in Russia.\\n\\nALLEGATIONS\\n\\n[11] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\\u2019s Basis of Claim forms and narratives in evidence. The claimants are a Ukrainian and Russian family from Ukraine. The principal claimant is a 34-year old Russian male, along with his 34-year old Ukrainian wife and their seven-year old Ukrainian child.\\n\\n[12] The claimants lived in XXXX (ph), Kyiv, Ukraine. In late XXXX 2022, the claimants fled from Ukraine to Switzerland after the Russian occupation of Ukraine as there was missiles and bombing of their country and their hometown, specifically.\\n\\n[13] The claimants then came to Canada in XXXX 2022, and made their refugee claim shortly after. The principal claimant is politically opposed to Russia\\u2019s military campaign and operation in Ukraine and does not want to participate in any war activities if he were forced to return to Russia now. The principal claimant moved from Russia to Ukraine in 2006 to study and has not been back to Russia since 2013. He received his Ukrainian permanent residency in 2014, and the principal claimant and associate claimant were married in 2015.\\n\\n[14] The principal claimant\\u2019s passport expires \\u2014 Russian passport expires in 2025, and he does not want to approach the Russian government to renew it for the purposes of applying for a permanent residency in Canada.\\n\\n[15] Okay, I will now assess whether there\\u2019s any possibility for article 1(e) exclusion for the principal claimant regarding his permanent resident status in Ukraine. An article 1(e) exclusion is whether the principal claimant should be excluded from refugee protection due to his permanent residency in Ukraine. The principal claimant provided his permanent resident permit for Ukraine in evidence. Pursuant to article 1(e), the Convention refugee definition does not apply to a person who\\u2019s recognized by the authorities of a country in which they have taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country. The test for determining whether article 1(e) applies is set out in Zhang and Zhang states that considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status substantially similar to that of its nationals in the third country. If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded; if the answer is no, then the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under article 1(e), and if the answer is yes, the RPD must consider on balanced factors \\u2014 various factors. These include, but are not limited, to the reason for the loss, which is voluntary or involuntary, whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in their home country, and Canada\\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\\n\\n[16] I find that the claimant had status in Ukraine substantially similar to that of Ukrainian nationals at the time of the hearing. However, in assessing whether an individual has status substantially similar to that of nationals of a third country, the jurisprudence as how a number of basic rights that are associated with nationality, including the right to return to the country of residence, the right to work freely without restrictions, the right to study, and full access to social services. The status should not be a temporary one (1) that must be renewed, and which may be cancelled. The claimant\\u2019s permanent residence permit for Ukraine was issued in 2014, as he was first in Ukraine \\u2014 as he moved to Ukraine to study in 2006 and lived with his Ukrainian grandmother. The claimant testified that he initially went to Ukraine to study and then met his now wife, who is the associate claimant, and he has not returned to Russia since 2013. He further testified that as a Russian in Ukraine he\\u2019s not able to acquire Ukrainian citizenship as he would first have to denounce his Russian citizenship. And Russia does currently not allow any Russians in Ukraine to denounce their citizenship. With that said, I do find that the status or the permanent resident status afforded to the principal claimant did allow him the rights that are substantially similar to those held by nationals of Ukraine. As the claimant was able to travel freely, and he also had the right to obtain employment and experience access to education and other social services in Ukraine.\\n\\n[17] However, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine the situation has deteriorated, and it is not clear whether or not permanent residents of Ukraine who have Russian citizenship are able to travel freely in and out of the country.\\n\\n[18] Okay, so based on all the evidence before me, I do find that permanent residents of Ukraine in the past did have rights substantially similar to nationals. That being said, the purpose of article 1(e) is to exclude individuals who do not require protection because they have some form of surrogate protection in another safe country where they enjoy substantially the same rights and obligations as nationals of that country. And while there has been some disagreement in the Federal Court as to whether any risk in the 1(e) country should be examined by the Refugee Protection Division, and whether it should be done at the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment stage, the Refugee Appeal Division decision MB800025 was identified as a jurisprudential guide that states that the preferred interpretation of the Convention is that allegations of risk in any country of residence are to be taken into consideration in the analysis of whether a refugee claimant is excluded from refugee protection under article 1(e). The RAD noted that despite some divergence, the court has consistently endorsed the approach of the RPD and RAD members in assessing the risk in the article 1(e) country. The reasoning being that people who face persecution or serious harm in their country of residence cannot be said to enjoy surrogate protection, as is the case in this claim.\\n\\n[19] Also, the object and purpose of the Convention in article 1(e) require decision-makers to consider any risk raised by a claimant in their country of residence before they can be excluded from refugee protection. This framework respects Canada\\u2019s international obligations that flow from article 1(e). Therefore, I have adopted this framework and assessed the risks to the principal claimant in Ukraine.\\n\\n[20] The principal claimant testified that he\\u2019s a Russian citizen and would not be allowed to re-enter Ukraine using his Russian passport at this time due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine which began in February 2022. He testified that even if he were somehow able to re-enter Ukraine, he would face harm as a Russian citizen who would be perceived as being pro-Russian, and he would also face a risk of harm from the ongoing bombings and missiles in Ukraine now.\\n\\n[21] Therefore, based on the claimant\\u2019s testimony, and the objective evidence which will be assessed below, I find that he has established a nexus to the Convention on the grounds of his imputed or actual political opinion as a Russian in Ukraine if he were to return to Ukraine now. I also considered that the claimant would face a risk in Ukraine as someone who could be forced into conscription by the Ukrainian military.\\n\\n[22] According to the National Documentation Package for Ukraine, at NDP item 2.2, an Amnesty International Report states that members of far right groups target marginalized groups with harassment, intimidation, and violence, and often with total impunity.\\n\\n[23] NDP article \\u2014 item 1.27 is article for a report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which state that there are numerous reports of individuals perceived as being pro-Russian supporters who are mistreated and beaten by police, volunteer defence force members and others in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine.\\n\\nThe mistreatment, carried out by police officers, members of the territorial defence or civilians, usually consists of such individuals being duct taped to electricity poles or trees, partially or fully stripped, beaten, including with sticks and rods, and sprayed with paint or having the word marauder written on their body or clothes.\\n\\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has documented more than 45 such cases.\\n\\n[24] But that was as of June 2022, and the number is most likely higher at this point in time.\\n\\n[25] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find the principal claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution that \\u2014 and it objectively \\u2014 and he has established that his subjective fear is objectively well-founded. And I find the principal claimant would find a risk of persecution in Ukraine based on his imputed or actual political opinion if he were to return now as a Russian citizen.\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nIdentity\\n\\n[26] I am satisfied with the personal and national identity of the principal claimant as a citizen of Russia which is established by his testimony and the copies of his passport in evidence. I\\u2019m also satisfied with the personal and national identities of the associate claimant and minor claimant as citizens of Ukraine which is established by the associate claimant\\u2019s testimony and the copy of their passports in evidence.\\n\\nCredibility\\n\\n[27] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there\\u2019s reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. They testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed and candid manner, and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between the claimants\\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in this case. They did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence. And in summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of their claims.\\n\\n[28] I find the claimants provided ample details to expand upon their allegations, and they also provided a great deal of evidence prior to the hearing, which included a number of identity documents as well as their birth-certificates and newspaper articles, and they also including, during the hearing, social media posts that the principal claimant wrote on both Facebook and Instagram that he submitted into evidence during the hearing.\\n\\n[29] Given the claimants\\u2019 careful testimonies, I find they have established on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in their claims. Including that the claimants are a mixed Russian/Ukrainian family, and they fear a risk of harm in both Russia, due to their political opinion or imputed political opinion, as well as in Ukraine due to the ongoing war.\\n\\n[30] In sum, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses and, therefore, believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\\n\\nNexus\\n\\n[31] To qualify for refugee status under the refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The allegations establishing nexus to the Convention for the principal claimant on the ground of his imputed or actual political opinion as a Russian who has publicly shared his anti-Russian views with his community both on social media as well as in person, or on the phone. Furthermore, the associate claimant and minor claimant have established a nexus to the Convention as they are members of a particular social group, as women or girls who face a risk of gender-based violence in a situation of war in Ukraine.\\n\\n[32] Based on the aforementioned evidence, I will assess their claims under section 96.\\n\\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm for the Principal Claimant in Russia\\n\\n[33] The principal claimant testified that he will be arrested and harmed if he returns to Russia now as he will be perceived as a foreign agent or a spy as he lived in Ukraine since 2006 and married a Ukrainian. He further testified that he has since the war began he has shared his political views speaking out against the Russian Regime on social media as well as the family members in Russia who strongly disagree with his perspective. The principal claimant fears a risk to his life due to his actual or imputed political opinion in Russia.\\n\\n[34] According to the National Documentation Package at item 2.23 of the NDP, an Austrian Red Cross Report from May 2022, states that, on the 7th of April 2022, they published an article which deals with the prosecution of anti-war dissidents in Russia. This report notes the following. The authorities are exerting unprecedented pressure on dissenters. There are mass detentions and protest participants are being threatened with criminal prosecution for participating in activities of extremist organizations. The details of criminal cases against those opposing the war are not always known but their overall demeanour and the identities of those persecuted suggests the authorities are using the war as an excuse to crush dissent and totally cleanse civil society. Despite the numerous instances of violence perpetrated by representatives of the authorities who unjustifiably detain people at demonstrations, not a single criminal court case has been filed in response to these acts. Nonetheless, criminal proceedings can taint people against protestors for violence against police officers. Experience has shown that unbiased investigations and due process in such cases are not upheld in Russia. On the contrary, judicial proceedings are characterized by a blatant disregard for procedural norms and evidence for the defence. Penalties are disproportionate even for formal charges.\\n\\n[35] According to the Russian NDP at item 2.26, it states that media and internet providers or social networks which make information about the conflict in Ukraine accessible to the Russian public, are threatened with criminal prosecution and asked to remove the information. Furthermore, the principal claimant stated that he would be refused \\u2014 that he could be forced to be conscripted into the Russian military if he were to return to Russia now.\\n\\n[36] According to NDP item 8.1, persons refusing to take part in the hostilities in Ukraine, as well as their family members, could face persecution by the authorities. Persons persecuted by law enforcement and convicted prisoners were also reported to be among the involuntary recruits. Human Rights activists reported that interned men who refused their deployment to Ukraine were threatened with contrived criminal proceedings.\\n\\n[37] In sum, based on all the evidence before me, I find the principal claimant has established that he would face a serious risk to his life if he were to return to Russia now as a Ukrainian permanent resident who lived in Ukraine for many years. His fear is indeed well-founded.\\n\\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm in Ukraine\\n\\n[38] I also find the associate and minor claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine based on their actual or imputed political opinion. As well as they could face persecution in Ukraine due to the ongoing war and a particular risk if they\\u2019re women or girls.\\n\\n[39] The National Documentation Package for Ukraine which includes a U.S. Department of State Report at item 2.1 indicates that in Russian controlled areas of Ukraine, Russian-led forces have engaged in unlawful or widespread civilian harm, and forced disappearances, or abductions, and torture or physical abuses of punishment. The report also states that in these areas there are significant human rights issues including arbitrary arrests, political prisoners, serious restriction on free expression, and substantial interference with freedom of assembly and religion. And the associate claimant and the minor claimant could be perceived as being pro-Russian due to their membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant.\\n\\n[40] NDP item 1.6 for Ukraine states that since the beginning of Russia\\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine the ACLED records nearly 40,000 political violence events across the country. Three-quarters of these events are shelling, artillery and missile strikes, mostly effecting the north-eastern, eastern, and southern regions of Ukraine.\\n\\n[41] Meanwhile the long range strikes, including those deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure which pose a permanent threat and continue to induce extreme hardship for communities who are farther afield from the frontline.\\n\\n[42] Amnesty International Reports at item 1.7 of the NDP for Ukraine that according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, nearly one-third of Ukrainians have been displaced by the conflict and 6.2 million people remain displaced within Ukraine, and 7.8 million are estimated to be refugees in Europe.\\n\\n[43] Regarding any additional risk that the associate claimant and minor claimant may face as women or girls in Ukraine is corroborated in the NDP. The objective evidence, in particular a rapid gender analysis by Care International and U.N. Women at NDP item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country. And they face significantly increased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence and conflict related sexual violence. This report further delves into the challenges for women of all ages to access agent services in war torn areas of Eastern Ukraine, and many have fled and faced further hurdles in accessing safe shelters in the Western Region of the country.\\n\\n[44] Women and girls are also more at risk of conflict-based sexual assault. And NDP item 5.2 states that there is increasing and concerning media reports on conflict related sexual violence emerging in Ukraine.\\n\\n[45] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the associate and minor claimant have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine due to their membership in a particular social group as women or girls, as well as their actual or imputed political opinion as they are in a family with a Russian citizen and, therefore, I find the claimants would face a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if they were to return to Ukraine now.\\n\\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative in Russia\\n\\n[46] In all refugee claims the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, given that the government is an agent of persecution for the principal claimant in Russia, it appears objectively unreasonable for the principal claimant to seek the protection of the state. Consequently, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\\n\\n[47] With respect to an Internal Flight Alternative, or IFA, I do not find that the principal claimant could safely live in any other part of Russia given that the agent of persecution is the government, and he cannot be expected to hide from the state.\\n\\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative in Ukraine for the Associate and Minor Claimant\\n\\n[48] I find there is clear and convincing evidence that the Ukrainian state is in a state of complete breakdown as a result of the ongoing large-scale Russian invasion and that for this reason the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. State protection would not be available to the claimants if they were to return to Ukraine now and seek it. Furthermore, in regard to the Internal Flight Alternative, the UNHCR at item 1.23 of the Ukrainian NDP states that it does not consider appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative.\\n\\n[49] Based on this evidence and considering the current state of events in Ukraine, I find there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative available for the claimants there.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n[50] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I accept each of their claims.\\n\\n[51] Thank you for bearing with me through that lengthy set of reasons, and congratulations.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Russia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"case_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PSG: SOGIE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"member\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hannah Gray\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GENAI_country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Russia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And you will also receive a written version of this decision in the mail, okay? So I will begin by telling you that my decision is a positive one (1), and I have accepted each of your claims, so congratulations.\\n\\n[2] CLAIMANT: Thank you.\\n\\n[3] ASSOCIATE CLAIMANT: Thank you very much.\\n\\n[4] MEMBER: You\\u2019re very welcome. I\\u2019m now going to read you the reasons for my decision, and they\\u2019re a bit lengthy, so just bear with me while I read those, okay?\\n\\n[5] Okay, this is the decision of the Refugee Protection Division in the claims of XXXX XXXX, and his spouse, XXXX XXXX, and their daughter, XXXX XXXX of Ukraine, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the IRPA.\\n\\n[6] At the hearing, the associate claimant, who is the mother of the minor claimant, acted as the designated representative for her daughter pursuant to subsection 167(2) of the Act, and Rule 20 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\\n\\n[7] I have considered and applied the Chairperson\\u2019s Guideline 4 on Gender Considerations in Proceedings Before the Immigration and Refugee Board, which offers guidance with respect to any gender-specific issues present in this claim.\\n\\n[8] I\\u2019ve also applied and considered the Chairperson\\u2019s Guidelines on child refugee claimants, procedural and evidentiary issues as it relates to the claim of the minor claimant.\\n\\n[9] The claimants were self-represented for their hearing.\\n\\nDETERMINATION\\n\\n[10] I find that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on their well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine. I also find that the principal claimant is a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA based on his well-founded fear of persecution in Russia.\\n\\nALLEGATIONS\\n\\n[11] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimant\\u2019s Basis of Claim forms and narratives in evidence. The claimants are a Ukrainian and Russian family from Ukraine. The principal claimant is a 34-year old Russian male, along with his 34-year old Ukrainian wife and their seven-year old Ukrainian child.\\n\\n[12] The claimants lived in XXXX (ph), Kyiv, Ukraine. In late XXXX 2022, the claimants fled from Ukraine to Switzerland after the Russian occupation of Ukraine as there was missiles and bombing of their country and their hometown, specifically.\\n\\n[13] The claimants then came to Canada in XXXX 2022, and made their refugee claim shortly after. The principal claimant is politically opposed to Russia\\u2019s military campaign and operation in Ukraine and does not want to participate in any war activities if he were forced to return to Russia now. The principal claimant moved from Russia to Ukraine in 2006 to study and has not been back to Russia since 2013. He received his Ukrainian permanent residency in 2014, and the principal claimant and associate claimant were married in 2015.\\n\\n[14] The principal claimant\\u2019s passport expires \\u2014 Russian passport expires in 2025, and he does not want to approach the Russian government to renew it for the purposes of applying for a permanent residency in Canada.\\n\\n[15] Okay, I will now assess whether there\\u2019s any possibility for article 1(e) exclusion for the principal claimant regarding his permanent resident status in Ukraine. An article 1(e) exclusion is whether the principal claimant should be excluded from refugee protection due to his permanent residency in Ukraine. The principal claimant provided his permanent resident permit for Ukraine in evidence. Pursuant to article 1(e), the Convention refugee definition does not apply to a person who\\u2019s recognized by the authorities of a country in which they have taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country. The test for determining whether article 1(e) applies is set out in Zhang and Zhang states that considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status substantially similar to that of its nationals in the third country. If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded; if the answer is no, then the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under article 1(e), and if the answer is yes, the RPD must consider on balanced factors \\u2014 various factors. These include, but are not limited, to the reason for the loss, which is voluntary or involuntary, whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in their home country, and Canada\\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\\n\\n[16] I find that the claimant had status in Ukraine substantially similar to that of Ukrainian nationals at the time of the hearing. However, in assessing whether an individual has status substantially similar to that of nationals of a third country, the jurisprudence as how a number of basic rights that are associated with nationality, including the right to return to the country of residence, the right to work freely without restrictions, the right to study, and full access to social services. The status should not be a temporary one (1) that must be renewed, and which may be cancelled. The claimant\\u2019s permanent residence permit for Ukraine was issued in 2014, as he was first in Ukraine \\u2014 as he moved to Ukraine to study in 2006 and lived with his Ukrainian grandmother. The claimant testified that he initially went to Ukraine to study and then met his now wife, who is the associate claimant, and he has not returned to Russia since 2013. He further testified that as a Russian in Ukraine he\\u2019s not able to acquire Ukrainian citizenship as he would first have to denounce his Russian citizenship. And Russia does currently not allow any Russians in Ukraine to denounce their citizenship. With that said, I do find that the status or the permanent resident status afforded to the principal claimant did allow him the rights that are substantially similar to those held by nationals of Ukraine. As the claimant was able to travel freely, and he also had the right to obtain employment and experience access to education and other social services in Ukraine.\\n\\n[17] However, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine the situation has deteriorated, and it is not clear whether or not permanent residents of Ukraine who have Russian citizenship are able to travel freely in and out of the country.\\n\\n[18] Okay, so based on all the evidence before me, I do find that permanent residents of Ukraine in the past did have rights substantially similar to nationals. That being said, the purpose of article 1(e) is to exclude individuals who do not require protection because they have some form of surrogate protection in another safe country where they enjoy substantially the same rights and obligations as nationals of that country. And while there has been some disagreement in the Federal Court as to whether any risk in the 1(e) country should be examined by the Refugee Protection Division, and whether it should be done at the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment stage, the Refugee Appeal Division decision MB800025 was identified as a jurisprudential guide that states that the preferred interpretation of the Convention is that allegations of risk in any country of residence are to be taken into consideration in the analysis of whether a refugee claimant is excluded from refugee protection under article 1(e). The RAD noted that despite some divergence, the court has consistently endorsed the approach of the RPD and RAD members in assessing the risk in the article 1(e) country. The reasoning being that people who face persecution or serious harm in their country of residence cannot be said to enjoy surrogate protection, as is the case in this claim.\\n\\n[19] Also, the object and purpose of the Convention in article 1(e) require decision-makers to consider any risk raised by a claimant in their country of residence before they can be excluded from refugee protection. This framework respects Canada\\u2019s international obligations that flow from article 1(e). Therefore, I have adopted this framework and assessed the risks to the principal claimant in Ukraine.\\n\\n[20] The principal claimant testified that he\\u2019s a Russian citizen and would not be allowed to re-enter Ukraine using his Russian passport at this time due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine which began in February 2022. He testified that even if he were somehow able to re-enter Ukraine, he would face harm as a Russian citizen who would be perceived as being pro-Russian, and he would also face a risk of harm from the ongoing bombings and missiles in Ukraine now.\\n\\n[21] Therefore, based on the claimant\\u2019s testimony, and the objective evidence which will be assessed below, I find that he has established a nexus to the Convention on the grounds of his imputed or actual political opinion as a Russian in Ukraine if he were to return to Ukraine now. I also considered that the claimant would face a risk in Ukraine as someone who could be forced into conscription by the Ukrainian military.\\n\\n[22] According to the National Documentation Package for Ukraine, at NDP item 2.2, an Amnesty International Report states that members of far right groups target marginalized groups with harassment, intimidation, and violence, and often with total impunity.\\n\\n[23] NDP article \\u2014 item 1.27 is article for a report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which state that there are numerous reports of individuals perceived as being pro-Russian supporters who are mistreated and beaten by police, volunteer defence force members and others in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine.\\n\\nThe mistreatment, carried out by police officers, members of the territorial defence or civilians, usually consists of such individuals being duct taped to electricity poles or trees, partially or fully stripped, beaten, including with sticks and rods, and sprayed with paint or having the word marauder written on their body or clothes.\\n\\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has documented more than 45 such cases.\\n\\n[24] But that was as of June 2022, and the number is most likely higher at this point in time.\\n\\n[25] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find the principal claimant has established a subjective fear of persecution that \\u2014 and it objectively \\u2014 and he has established that his subjective fear is objectively well-founded. And I find the principal claimant would find a risk of persecution in Ukraine based on his imputed or actual political opinion if he were to return now as a Russian citizen.\\n\\nANALYSIS\\n\\nIdentity\\n\\n[26] I am satisfied with the personal and national identity of the principal claimant as a citizen of Russia which is established by his testimony and the copies of his passport in evidence. I\\u2019m also satisfied with the personal and national identities of the associate claimant and minor claimant as citizens of Ukraine which is established by the associate claimant\\u2019s testimony and the copy of their passports in evidence.\\n\\nCredibility\\n\\n[27] When a claimant swears to the truth of their allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there\\u2019s reason to doubt their truthfulness. In this case, I find no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimants. They testified in a straightforward, forthright, detailed and candid manner, and there were no material inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions between the claimants\\u2019 testimonies and the other evidence in this case. They did not exaggerate or tailor their evidence. And in summary, their testimonies were consistent with the other evidence on the central aspects of their claims.\\n\\n[28] I find the claimants provided ample details to expand upon their allegations, and they also provided a great deal of evidence prior to the hearing, which included a number of identity documents as well as their birth-certificates and newspaper articles, and they also including, during the hearing, social media posts that the principal claimant wrote on both Facebook and Instagram that he submitted into evidence during the hearing.\\n\\n[29] Given the claimants\\u2019 careful testimonies, I find they have established on a balance of probabilities, the facts alleged in their claims. Including that the claimants are a mixed Russian/Ukrainian family, and they fear a risk of harm in both Russia, due to their political opinion or imputed political opinion, as well as in Ukraine due to the ongoing war.\\n\\n[30] In sum, I find the claimants to be credible witnesses and, therefore, believe what they have alleged in support of their claims.\\n\\nNexus\\n\\n[31] To qualify for refugee status under the refugee Convention, an individual must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The allegations establishing nexus to the Convention for the principal claimant on the ground of his imputed or actual political opinion as a Russian who has publicly shared his anti-Russian views with his community both on social media as well as in person, or on the phone. Furthermore, the associate claimant and minor claimant have established a nexus to the Convention as they are members of a particular social group, as women or girls who face a risk of gender-based violence in a situation of war in Ukraine.\\n\\n[32] Based on the aforementioned evidence, I will assess their claims under section 96.\\n\\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm for the Principal Claimant in Russia\\n\\n[33] The principal claimant testified that he will be arrested and harmed if he returns to Russia now as he will be perceived as a foreign agent or a spy as he lived in Ukraine since 2006 and married a Ukrainian. He further testified that he has since the war began he has shared his political views speaking out against the Russian Regime on social media as well as the family members in Russia who strongly disagree with his perspective. The principal claimant fears a risk to his life due to his actual or imputed political opinion in Russia.\\n\\n[34] According to the National Documentation Package at item 2.23 of the NDP, an Austrian Red Cross Report from May 2022, states that, on the 7th of April 2022, they published an article which deals with the prosecution of anti-war dissidents in Russia. This report notes the following. The authorities are exerting unprecedented pressure on dissenters. There are mass detentions and protest participants are being threatened with criminal prosecution for participating in activities of extremist organizations. The details of criminal cases against those opposing the war are not always known but their overall demeanour and the identities of those persecuted suggests the authorities are using the war as an excuse to crush dissent and totally cleanse civil society. Despite the numerous instances of violence perpetrated by representatives of the authorities who unjustifiably detain people at demonstrations, not a single criminal court case has been filed in response to these acts. Nonetheless, criminal proceedings can taint people against protestors for violence against police officers. Experience has shown that unbiased investigations and due process in such cases are not upheld in Russia. On the contrary, judicial proceedings are characterized by a blatant disregard for procedural norms and evidence for the defence. Penalties are disproportionate even for formal charges.\\n\\n[35] According to the Russian NDP at item 2.26, it states that media and internet providers or social networks which make information about the conflict in Ukraine accessible to the Russian public, are threatened with criminal prosecution and asked to remove the information. Furthermore, the principal claimant stated that he would be refused \\u2014 that he could be forced to be conscripted into the Russian military if he were to return to Russia now.\\n\\n[36] According to NDP item 8.1, persons refusing to take part in the hostilities in Ukraine, as well as their family members, could face persecution by the authorities. Persons persecuted by law enforcement and convicted prisoners were also reported to be among the involuntary recruits. Human Rights activists reported that interned men who refused their deployment to Ukraine were threatened with contrived criminal proceedings.\\n\\n[37] In sum, based on all the evidence before me, I find the principal claimant has established that he would face a serious risk to his life if he were to return to Russia now as a Ukrainian permanent resident who lived in Ukraine for many years. His fear is indeed well-founded.\\n\\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution and Risk of Harm in Ukraine\\n\\n[38] I also find the associate and minor claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine based on their actual or imputed political opinion. As well as they could face persecution in Ukraine due to the ongoing war and a particular risk if they\\u2019re women or girls.\\n\\n[39] The National Documentation Package for Ukraine which includes a U.S. Department of State Report at item 2.1 indicates that in Russian controlled areas of Ukraine, Russian-led forces have engaged in unlawful or widespread civilian harm, and forced disappearances, or abductions, and torture or physical abuses of punishment. The report also states that in these areas there are significant human rights issues including arbitrary arrests, political prisoners, serious restriction on free expression, and substantial interference with freedom of assembly and religion. And the associate claimant and the minor claimant could be perceived as being pro-Russian due to their membership in a particular social group as family members of the principal claimant.\\n\\n[40] NDP item 1.6 for Ukraine states that since the beginning of Russia\\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine the ACLED records nearly 40,000 political violence events across the country. Three-quarters of these events are shelling, artillery and missile strikes, mostly effecting the north-eastern, eastern, and southern regions of Ukraine.\\n\\n[41] Meanwhile the long range strikes, including those deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure which pose a permanent threat and continue to induce extreme hardship for communities who are farther afield from the frontline.\\n\\n[42] Amnesty International Reports at item 1.7 of the NDP for Ukraine that according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, nearly one-third of Ukrainians have been displaced by the conflict and 6.2 million people remain displaced within Ukraine, and 7.8 million are estimated to be refugees in Europe.\\n\\n[43] Regarding any additional risk that the associate claimant and minor claimant may face as women or girls in Ukraine is corroborated in the NDP. The objective evidence, in particular a rapid gender analysis by Care International and U.N. Women at NDP item 5.6 states that women constitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country. And they face significantly increased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence, particularly domestic violence and conflict related sexual violence. This report further delves into the challenges for women of all ages to access agent services in war torn areas of Eastern Ukraine, and many have fled and faced further hurdles in accessing safe shelters in the Western Region of the country.\\n\\n[44] Women and girls are also more at risk of conflict-based sexual assault. And NDP item 5.2 states that there is increasing and concerning media reports on conflict related sexual violence emerging in Ukraine.\\n\\n[45] Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the associate and minor claimant have established a well-founded fear of persecution in Ukraine due to their membership in a particular social group as women or girls, as well as their actual or imputed political opinion as they are in a family with a Russian citizen and, therefore, I find the claimants would face a serious forward-facing possibility of persecution if they were to return to Ukraine now.\\n\\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative in Russia\\n\\n[46] In all refugee claims the state is presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. In this case, given that the government is an agent of persecution for the principal claimant in Russia, it appears objectively unreasonable for the principal claimant to seek the protection of the state. Consequently, the presumption of state protection has been rebutted.\\n\\n[47] With respect to an Internal Flight Alternative, or IFA, I do not find that the principal claimant could safely live in any other part of Russia given that the agent of persecution is the government, and he cannot be expected to hide from the state.\\n\\nState Protection and Internal Flight Alternative in Ukraine for the Associate and Minor Claimant\\n\\n[48] I find there is clear and convincing evidence that the Ukrainian state is in a state of complete breakdown as a result of the ongoing large-scale Russian invasion and that for this reason the presumption of state protection has been rebutted. State protection would not be available to the claimants if they were to return to Ukraine now and seek it. Furthermore, in regard to the Internal Flight Alternative, the UNHCR at item 1.23 of the Ukrainian NDP states that it does not consider appropriate to deny international protection to Ukrainians and former habitual residents of Ukraine on the basis of an internal flight or relocation alternative.\\n\\n[49] Based on this evidence and considering the current state of events in Ukraine, I find there is no viable Internal Flight Alternative available for the claimants there.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n[50] For the reasons above, I determine that the claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act and I accept each of their claims.\\n\\n[51] Thank you for bearing with me through that lengthy set of reasons, and congratulations.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 REASONS CONCLUDED \\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Russia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"case_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PSG: SOGIE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"member\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hannah Gray\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GENAI_country\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Russia\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"GENAI_gender\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"male\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
