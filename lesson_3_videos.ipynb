He was the son of Thomas Ritchie and Elizabeth Wildman Johnstone. After graduating from the Pictou Academy, he studied law in Halifax in the office of his brother, John William Ritchie. He was called to the bar of Nova Scotia in 1837 but moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, and was called to the bar of that province the following year. In 1846 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick. In keeping with his pledge to resign if a fellow Liberal candidate failed to win a by-election, he gave up his seat in 1851, only to be re-elected three years later. In 1855 he left politics to accept an appointment to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and 10 years later he was named Chief Justice of New Brunswick. He was appointed to the newly established Supreme Court of Canada on September 30, 1875 and became its chief justice on January 11, 1879. He served on the Supreme Court for 17 years. Chief Justice Ritchie died on September 25, 1892, at the age of 78.\",\n          \"Samuel Henry Strong was born in Poole, England, on August 13, 1825. He was the son of Samuel Spratt Strong and Jane Elizabeth Gosse. \\r\\n    His family emigrated to Canada in 1836 and settled in Bytown, Upper Canada (Ottawa, Ontario). While enrolled as a student with the\\r\\n    Law Society of Upper Canada, he articled with Augustus Keefer of Bytown, then with Henry Eccles of Toronto. Called to the bar in 1849, \\r\\n    he established his practice in Toronto, where he later founded the firm of Strong & Matheson. In 1869, as a legal adviser to Prime \\r\\n    Minister John A. Macdonald, he worked on a legislative proposal for the creation of a national supreme court. That year, he was \\r\\n    appointed Vice-chancellor of the Court of Chancery of Ontario, and in 1874 he was elevated to the Ontario Court of Error & Appeal. \\r\\n    He was appointed to the newly established Supreme Court of Canada on September 30, 1875 and named Chief Justice of Canada on \\r\\n    December 13, 1892. He served on the Supreme Court for 27 years before retiring on November 18, 1902.

            "### Summary: *British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Christie* (2007 SCC 21)\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **Facts:**\n",
            "In 1993, British Columbia introduced the *Social Service Tax Amendment Act (No. 2)*, which imposed a 7% tax on legal services. Although this tax purportedly funded legal aid, the revenue was not specifically allocated to this purpose, instead going to general provincial revenues. Dugald Christie, a lawyer serving low-income clients, challenged the tax. He argued that it increased the cost of legal services, thereby making it impossible for many low-income individuals to hire legal counsel and access justice. The chambers judge agreed, finding the tax unconstitutional for violating a fundamental right to access justice. The British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld this decision in a majority ruling.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **Issues:**\n",
            "1. Does the Constitution recognize a fundamental, general right to legal counsel in access-to-justice contexts, thereby making the tax unconstitutional?\n",
            "2. Does the tax infringe on a constitutional right to access the courts?\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **Reasoning:**\n",
            "The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) allowed the appeal, finding that the legal services tax is constitutional. The Court's key points:\n",
            "- **Rule of Law and Access to Justice:** While access to justice and counsel is important, the Constitution does not provide a broad, general right to legal counsel in all cases involving rights and obligations.\n",
            "  - *Rule of Law:* Although the rule of law underpins the Canadian legal framework, it does not imply a universal right to legal counsel for effective access to courts. Instead, any constitutional right to counsel must be evaluated case-by-case.\n",
            "  - *Charter Context:* Section 10(b) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* explicitly provides the right to counsel for those arrested or detained. However, this does not support a broader constitutional right to legal counsel in civil cases.\n",
            "  - Where rights to counsel are recognized under Section 7 (life, liberty, security), these are case-specific and context-dependent, not generalizable to all litigation.\n",
            "- **Legislative Authority:** Provinces have the constitutional power under Section 92(14) of the *Constitution Act, 1867* to regulate access to courts, including imposing taxes.\n",
            "- **Adequate Evidence:** The Court underscored the lack of sufficient evidence linking the tax directly to the denial of access to justice. A causal and economic analysis of the tax's impact was not adequately presented.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **Outcome:**\n",
            "The SCC ruled in favor of the Attorney General of British Columbia, concluding that the tax on legal services was valid and did not violate any constitutional rights. It overturned the lower court rulings and dismissed Christie’s cross-appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
            "- There is no general constitutional right to legal counsel in courts or tribunals outside specific contexts (e.g., arrest/detention under Section 10(b) or procedural fairness under Section 7 of the *Charter*).\n",
            "- The rule of law does not imply a guaranteed right to legal aid or counsel for all.\n",
            "- Taxation on legal services, while potentially burdensome, is within provincial jurisdiction.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **Interesting Note:**\n",
            "Dugald Christie was a passionate advocate for increasing legal access for vulnerable populations. Tragically, he died during a cross-Canada fundraiser highlighting the very issue at the heart of this case. Despite his loss, this decision clarified key constitutional boundaries regarding access to justice and government policymaking.\n"

            "Welcome to today's episode where we're diving into a key Canadian Supreme Court case, British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Christie. This case is pivotal in understanding access to justice, or A2J, a significant topic in civil procedure.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, what's happening in this case? Back in 1993, British Columbia introduced the Social Service Tax Amendment Act, imposing a 7% tax on legal services. While the tax funds were intended to support legal aid, Dugald Christie, a Vancouver lawyer dedicated to providing legal assistance to low-income clients, challenged it. Christie's argument was simple: the tax made it excessively hard for his impoverished clients to afford necessary legal services, impacting their access to justice.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Supreme Court had to wrestle with two main issues: First, does this tax infringe on a constitutional right to access to justice, especially for low-income individuals? And second, is there a broader constitutional right to have legal counsel in court or tribunal proceedings that involve personal rights and obligations?\n",
            "\n",
            "In their reasoning, the court made several important points. They acknowledged that while access to justice is indeed a fundamental principle, the tax itself does not violate this access at a constitutional level. The court noted that the Canadian Constitution doesn't guarantee a broad, general right to legal counsel in every proceeding. If such a right existed broadly, it would render Section 10(b) of the Canadian Charter—which grants the right to counsel upon arrest or detention—redundant.\n",
            "\n",
            "For those advocating a broader right, the judgment highlights that legal representation in court isn't a universal constitutional entitlement. The court emphasized that the constitutional right to counsel emerges in specific scenarios, particularly in cases dealing with life, liberty, and personal security under Section 7 of the Charter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision that found the tax unconstitutional. They concluded that the taxation statute was within the province's jurisdiction and did not infringe on a constitutional right to access justice for low-income individuals. They allowed the appeal by the Attorney General of British Columbia and dismissed Christie's cross-appeal.\n",
            "\n",
            "What's particularly interesting about this case is the balance it tries to strike between the practical and philosophical aspects of justice. While Christie argued that the cost of accessing legal services is a barrier to justice, the court held firm on the absence of a universal right to subsidized legal services outside specific circumstances.\n",
            "\n",
            "This decision underscores the complexity of access to justice issues within the framework of Canada's Constitution, serving as a critical reference point for discussions on the role of government in facilitating access to legal services, especially for marginalized communities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thanks for tuning in to this episode. We hope you’ve gained more insight into the Canadian legal landscape and the ongoing challenges in ensuring access to justice for all. Until next time, stay informed and engaged!\n"
